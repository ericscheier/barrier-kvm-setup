# GitHub Push Instructions

The repository is ready to push, but authentication is needed. Choose one of these methods:

## Option 1: Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Generate a new token with 'repo' scope
3. Run the push command and use your token as the password:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   # Username: ericscheier
   # Password: [paste your personal access token]
   ```

## Option 2: GitHub CLI (if available)

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI first, then:
gh auth login
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: SSH Key (if configured)

```bash
# Change to SSH remote
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ericscheier/barrier-kvm-setup.git
git push -u origin main
```
